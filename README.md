# Ludo

I am not the original creator of it as I used code from here:https://code-projects.org/simple-ludo-game-in-javascript-with-source-code/<br>
However, I modified it to fit my purposes.
Some of my contributions:<br>
a) Changed the board of the ludo game.<br>
[I created the board using the MS-Word]<br>
b) Implemented highlighting of tabs of certain color when it was their turn.<br> 

The overall output looks like this:
