# ludo

Most of the code was from here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st_ttaCqjpQ&ab_channel=TechnoGeek . But, I also have tweaked for my purposes.
Some of my contributions:
a) Changed board of the ludo game.<br>
[I created the board using the MS-Word]
b) Implemented highlighting of tabs of certain color when it was their turn.<br> 

The overall output looks like this:
