# Ludo

I am not the original creator of it as I used code from here:https://code-projects.org/simple-ludo-game-in-javascript-with-source-code/<br>
However, I modified it to fit my purpose.<br>

Some of my contributions:<br>
a) Changed the board of the ludo game.<br>

b) Implemented highlighting when it was player's turn.<br> 

c) I then deployed the game using Netlify.<br>

Previously it looked like this:

Now,it looks like this:

Here, is how the deployed game looks like in phone browser.
