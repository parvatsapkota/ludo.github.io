# ludo

Most of the code was from here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st_ttaCqjpQ&ab_channel=TechnoGeek . But, I also have tweaked for my purposes.
Some of my contributions:
a) Changing backgroud picture of the ludo game.
b) Highlighted tabs of certain color when it was their turn.

The overall output looks like this:
